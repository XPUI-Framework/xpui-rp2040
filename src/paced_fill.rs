//! A display whose solid fills go out one pixel at a time.
//!
//! An 8080-style parallel panel latches a byte on the rising edge of its write
//! strobe, and the controller has a minimum write *cycle* — 66 ns on the
//! ST7789v — that the strobe has to respect. A driver that sends a run of one
//! colour can notice the data lines already hold the right value and skip
//! setting them, leaving a loop that does nothing but pulse the strobe:
//!
//! ```text
//! wr.set_low();
//! wr.set_high();
//! ```
//!
//! Two register stores. On a 125 MHz RP2040 in release that is a write cycle
//! of roughly 24–40 ns — comfortably inside the controller's minimum, so it
//! mislatches, and the fill arrives as noise. Writing the data pins each time
//! is what keeps the cycle long enough; the shortcut is what breaks it.
//!
//! The trap is that the shortcut only triggers when every byte of the pixel is
//! **identical**, and for `Rgb565` over an 8-bit bus that is true of exactly
//! two colours: black (`0x0000`) and white (`0xFFFF`). Those are ink and
//! background on a monochrome-styled panel, so *every* filled rectangle and
//! every screen clear takes the broken path while text — which is drawn pixel
//! by pixel — comes out perfectly. A panel showing crisp type over static is
//! this bug, and it reads like a framework fault rather than a timing one.
//!
//! So fills are routed through `fill_contiguous`, which has a colour for every
//! pixel and therefore no run to shorten. A whole 320x240 screen costs about
//! 12 ms that way, against a panel with no refresh delay of its own to hide
//! behind — cheap for a fill that is correct.
//!
//! Wanted only by a parallel bus. An SPI panel clocks its own bytes out and a
//! framebuffer has no timing at all, so neither is wrapped — this is opt-in,
//! and a target that does not need it should not pay for it.
//!
